# Euclidean Distance

# **Description**

Euclidean distance is the distance between two points in Euclidean space. It is a special case of the more general Minkowski distance (p = 2). The Euclidean distance between points p and q is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\overline{pq}$). In Cartesian coordinates, if p = (p1, p2,..., pn) and q = (q1, q2,..., qn) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from p to q, or from q to p is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$$d(p,q) = \sqrt{(p_1 - q_1)^2 + (p_2 - q_2)^2 + ... + (p_n - q_n)^2} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (p_i - q_i)^2}$$

# **Usage**

Euclidean distance is used as a common metric to measure the similarity between two data points. It is used in machine learning for classification problems. For example, in the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, the Euclidean distance is used to find the nearest neighbors of a data point.

# **Example**

for example, we have two points p and q in 2D space, p = (1, 2) and q = (3, 4). The Euclidean distance between p and q is:

$d(p,q) = \sqrt{(1 - 3)^2 + (2 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{8} = 2.8284271247461903$
